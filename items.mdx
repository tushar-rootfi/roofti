* Unified item properties: The model unifies essential item details such as name, description, status, and type, making it easier to work with item data from different platforms.
* Item detail flexibility: The model supports separate details for items being purchased (`bill_item`) and items being sold (`invoice_item`), enabling accurate tracking of item-related transactions.
* Associated accounts and tax rates: Each item can be linked to specific purchase and sales accounts, as well as purchase and sales tax rates, for seamless integration with other accounting data models.

## Item Detail

**The Item Details Data Model** is a complementary model providing additional information about individual items.

* Associated account and tax: The model links items to their respective accounts and tax rates using `account_id` and `tax_id`, enabling seamless integration with other accounting data models.
* Detailed item description: The `description` property allows for a more in-depth understanding of each item's nature and purpose.
* Unit price tracking: The `unit_price` property records the cost of a single unit of the item, making it easy to calculate the total cost of transactions involving the item.
